    "### C. Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "- [ ] **C.1 Missing perspectives**: Have we sought to address blindspots in the analysis through engagement with relevant stakeholders (e.g., checking assumptions and discussing implications with affected communities and subject matter experts)?\n",
    "\n",
    "- [x] **C.2 Dataset bias**: Have we examined the data for possible sources of bias and taken steps to mitigate or address these biases (e.g., stereotype perpetuation, confirmation bias, imbalanced classes, or omitted confounding variables)?  \n",
    "  The data is collected from a single racecourse (Saga Racecourse) and therefore does not represent all horse races across different regions. In addition, betting odds are market prices rather than natural probabilities, as betting companies may adjust odds to manage risk and avoid losses.\n",
    "\n",
    "- [x] **C.3 Honest representation**: Are our visualizations, summary statistics, and reports designed to honestly represent the underlying data?\n",
    "    Our data is fair, and we will analyze the whole dataset. \n",
    "\n",
    "- [x] **C.4 Privacy in analysis**: Have we ensured that data with PII are not used or displayed unless necessary for the analysis?  \n",
    "  The analysis focuses on aggregated group-level results, and we avoid discussing or highlighting individual horses or horse racers.\n",
    "\n",
    "- [x] **C.5 Auditability**: Is the process of generating the analysis well documented and reproducible if we discover issues in the future?  \n",
    "  We clearly document how the data was obtained, the analytical steps taken, the conclusions drawn, and the formulas used.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "### D. Modeling\n",
    "\n",
    "- [ ] **D.1 Proxy discrimination**: Have we ensured that the model does not rely on variables or proxies for variables that are unfairly discriminatory?\n",
    "\n",
    "- [ ] **D.2 Fairness across groups**: Have we tested model results for fairness with respect to different affected groups (e.g., tested for disparate error rates)?\n",
    "\n",
    "- [x] **D.3 Metric selection**: Have we considered the effects of optimizing for our defined metrics and considered additional metrics?\n",
    "    We will classify the reasons for using specific metrics.\n",
    "\n",
    "- [x] **D.4 Explainability**: Can we explain in understandable terms a decision the model made in cases where a justification is needed?\n",
    "    We will explain the professional words and conceptions for better understanding.\n",
    "\n",
    "- [x] **D.5 Communicate limitations**: Have we communicated the shortcomings, limitations, and biases of the model to relevant stakeholders in ways that can be generally understood?\n",
    "    We will point out the limitations at the end of the reports.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### E. Deployment\n",
    "\n",
    "- [ ] **E.1 Monitoring and evaluation**: Do we have a clear plan to monitor the model and its impacts after it is deployed (e.g., performance monitoring, regular audit of sample predictions, human review of high-stakes decisions, reviewing downstream impacts of errors or low-confidence decisions, testing for concept drift)?\n",
    "      \n",
    "- [ ] **E.2 Redress**: Have we discussed with our organization a plan for response if users are harmed by the results (e.g., how does the data science team evaluate these cases and update analysis and models to prevent future harm)?\n",
    "\n",
    "- [ ] **E.3 Roll back**: Is there a way to turn off or roll back the model in production if necessary?\n",
    "\n",
    "- [x] **E.4 Unintended use**: Have we taken steps to identify and prevent unintended uses and abuse of the model and do we have a plan to monitor these once the model is deployed?  \n",
    "  We will clearly state that this analysis does not provide betting recommendations or gambling advice.\n"
