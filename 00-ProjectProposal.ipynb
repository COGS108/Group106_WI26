    "Horse racing is one of the oldest organized sports in the world, with a documented history dating back to ancient civilizations such as Greece, Rome, and China. Morden horse racing developed in Britain during the 17th and 18th centuries and later spread to the United States, where it was closely tied to gambling and probability-based decision making.<a href=\"#ref1\">1</a> Today, horse racing generates large-scale structured data, including race conditions, horse characteristics, jockey performance, and betting odds, making it a natural domain for quantitative analysis and predictive modeling.\n",
    "\n",
    "Beyond its historical and cultural significance, horse racing has served as an important real-world testbed for studying human decision-making under uncertainty for a long time. Betting markets associated with horse races have frequently been analyzed to understand whether markets efficiently incorporate available information. \n",
    "\n",
    "Prior economic research has shown that while betting odds often approximate true winning probabilities, systematic biases, such as the “favorite–longshot bias,” where longshots are overbet and favorites are underbet. This persists across races and contexts.<a href=\"#ref2\">2</a> These findings suggest that even in environments with rich information, human judgment and behavior can deviate from purely rational models.\n",
    "\n",
    "This work is relevant to our project because it establishes horse racing as a meaningful domain for studying probabilistic judgment and prediction. The presence of systematic biases suggests that historical race data contains informative patterns that can be analyzed and modeled, rather than being purely random or fully efficient. Building on this foundation, our project uses modern data analysis techniques to further explore predictive relationships within horse racing.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the prior work of this project, we use horse racing data as a case study for applying data analysis and predictive modeling to real-world decision-making contexts. By examining how measurable race and participant features relate to outcomes, we aim to better understand both the predictive structure of the data and how people react to them.\n",

    "To investigate the research question, we should obtain a dataset containing winning odds and actual payout, which is equal to the product of winning odds and the truth value of winning (0 for losing, 1 for winning) of entries of all races held at the Saga racecourse. Thus, winning odds are required, and we also need either the truth value of winning or the true return. All data should not contain any duplicates or any missing entries within a continuous range of time, to ensure completeness of data (investigating the population), thus avoiding biases. Although odds and winning or not are the only required variables, an unique identifier for races and racehorses is strongly suggested for data management, debugging and evaluation purposes. The total number of races between February 2015 and December 2025 is about 10000, which is more than enough for single-variable analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data will be collected both by using a web crawler and manually from an open and viable data source such as netkeiba.com, temporarily stored as a dictionary. This data can be stored as a tabular csv file with one line per entry (or in other words, per horse per race) after conversion to tabular format, and analyzed in the format of pandas dataframes in python.\n",

    "One potential real dataset can be the 'JRA日本中央競馬会 Horse Racing Dataset' on https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/takamotoki/jra-horse-racing-dataset. This dataset is open for use, but its last update is in 2021, before widespread use of artificial intelligence, which have unknown affects on bettor's ability to identify and wager on horses, changing the behavior of odds. This dataset also included all Japan Racing Association racing data, which does not include races at the Saga racecourse. This dataset contains winning and odds data enough for our project."

    " - [ ] **E.2 Redress**: Have we discussed with our organization a plan for response if users are harmed by the results (e.g., how does the data science team evaluate these cases and update analysis and models to prevent future harm)?\n",
    " - [ ] **E.3 Roll back**: Is there a way to turn off or roll back the model in production if necessary?\n",
    " - [ ] **E.4 Unintended use**: Have we taken steps to identify and prevent unintended uses and abuse of the model and do we have a plan to monitor these once the model is deployed?\n"
